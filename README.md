# PDF READER USING PYTHON

## Context

Argentine President Javier Mieli delivered an opening speech for the 2024 Congress session in early March.

While learning Python, I wanted to analyze his speech and get the most frequently used words in his speech.

In this project I worked with:
- Functions
- For loop
- Pdf Reader
- Sets
- If statement
- Dictionaries
- Word Cloud
